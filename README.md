# react-weather-app

To start, swap out the API key in /weather-app/src/.env to a valid Open Weather Map API key (I have deactiveated mine so do not try to use it). 

Next you can either use NPM or docker-compose to start the app. 

For NPM, from /weather-app run npm start

For Docker from / run docker-compose up --build.
