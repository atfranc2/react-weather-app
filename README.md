# React Weather App

## About 

A very simple and straighforward appication that uses the Open Weather Map API to dispaly current and forcasted weather conditions in Heidenheim, Germany. 

Future improvements could include: 
- Allowing user to change location
- Allowing user to change display units
- Showing more granular detail about forcasted conditions, such as hourly forcasted temperature, precipitation probability, and wind speen. 

## Startup Instructions

To start, swap out the API key in /weather-app/src/.env to a valid Open Weather Map API key (I have deactiveated mine so do not try to use it). 

Next you can either use NPM or docker-compose to start the app. 

For NPM, from /weather-app run npm start

For Docker from / run docker-compose up --build.
